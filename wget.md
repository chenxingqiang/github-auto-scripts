1. Open your preferred terminal or command-line interface on your computer.

2. Navigate to the directory where you want to download the files from the URL.

3. Copy the following command:
   
   ```
   wget -r -np --no-host-directories -nc https://isip.piconepress.com/courses/
   ```

4. Paste the command into the terminal or command-line interface.

5. Press Enter to execute the command.

6. `wget` will start recursively downloading files from the specified URL (`https://isip.piconepress.com/courses/`) to your current directory.

   - `-r` enables recursive downloading, allowing `wget` to follow links and download files from subdirectories.
   - `-np` prevents `wget` from ascending to the parent directory, restricting the download to the specified URL and its subdirectories.
   - `--no-host-directories` ensures that `wget` doesn't create host directories, keeping the downloaded files organized based on their original paths.
   - `-nc` or `--no-clobber` option skips downloading files that already exist in the destination directory, avoiding overwriting existing files.

7. Wait for `wget` to complete the download process. The time it takes will depend on the size and number of files being downloaded.

Once the process is finished, you should have the downloaded files from the specified URL in your current directory.

Remember to respect the terms of use and any applicable regulations while downloading and using the files.
